This week was dedicated to gathering everything from Sprint 1 and reviewing what had been completed so far. It was an essential time to reflect on the progress made, check the clientâ€™s feedback, and align our work with the initial project specification. We discussed what went well, what needed improvement, and what actions we could take moving into Sprint 2.
One of the key activities was consolidating all the deliverables and reviewing any outstanding tasks or issues from Sprint 1. I made sure that everything was organized and up-to-date in the repository, and I also assisted with finalizing the documentation. From this review, we identified key areas that required further attention, such as refining certain features, implementing additional validations, and enhancing UI/UX elements based on client feedback.
