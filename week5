i started with the case manager dashbaord on the front end while wating for the database schema after receving that from  qas i connected it with the back end.
shortly after that i went and started doing the crate case for the front end while kaleb was working on the back end for it.
and then after receving the headbar and navbar from dante i went ahead and make sure all the pages looked the wireframes we intially create.
