This week, our focus was on organizing and assigning tasks for Sprint 2 using Trello. As a team, we took the time to evaluate each member’s strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that tasks were aligned with what each person does best. We made a conscious effort to assign roles based on individual skills and expertise, rather than assigning tasks that would highlight weaknesses.

For example, I’m stronger in front-end development and report-related tasks, so I focused on anything that involved UI/UX, CSS, and writing or updating documentation. I also took on the responsibility of preparing some of the project reports, as it aligns with my strengths. On the other hand, I’m not as comfortable with database tasks, so I stepped back from that area and made sure others who are more proficient in database management took the lead there.

This approach helped ensure that everyone felt confident and capable in their assigned tasks. It also allowed us to maximize efficiency and productivity, knowing that each person was working on what they do best. By doing this, we aimed to build on our collective strengths and ensure a smooth workflow throughout Sprint 2.
