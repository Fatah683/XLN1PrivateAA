This week, my primary focus was on working on my STAR report, specifically addressing the project specification and how I planned my role within the team. The task involved analyzing the client’s requirements and producing a clear plan for the sprint. I also had to describe the tasks I was allocated, the tools and techniques we intended to use, and the software development methodology adopted.
The major challenge I faced was getting stuck when trying to make the work flow logically and make sense within the report. I found myself rushing to complete it because I left the task to the last minute, which only made it harder to refine my ideas and present them clearly. This rush led to some frustrations as I struggled to tie all the points together effectively.
I had to take some time To step back and review my work carefully, trying to re-organize my thoughts so that they aligned more cohesively with the rest of the report. Looking ahead, I recognize that better time management will help me avoid this stress in the future and produce more polished work without having to rush.
