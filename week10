for week10 
Monday/Tuesday: I began working on the "Forgot Password" functionality, ensuring that it operated correctly. I faced challenges with time management and arriving to class on time, but I remained in communication with my team throughout. Despite these obstacles, I successfully implemented the "Forgot Password" button.

Wednesday/Thursday: I focused on creating the test cases and acceptance tests. This task was relatively straightforward since I had experience from last semester, so I revisited my previous work and made the necessary adjustments.

Friday: We had a client meeting, which I believe went well. I actively participated and ensured that the team's progress and challenges were communicated effectively.
